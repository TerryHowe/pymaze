# Python Maze

When I frist started learning new languages, I always would first write
a 3D maze program.  Some of the mazes and some where text based, but
every maze had some common features:

* Read maze from a file
* parse the file to generate the maze
* render the maze graphically or through text
* Allow WASD movement through the maze

Some were web based applications and some were standalone, but they all
combine some components of a basica application such as file I/O, parsing,
graphics or screen type I/O, and user interaction from the keyboard.

I already have been using Python for years, but I thought I'd go back and
do this exercise for Python using Django.
