# Python Maze

It used to be that when I wanted to learn a new language, I would write
a 3D maze program.  It was a fun way to learn a language.  Some of the
mazes graphical and some where text based, but every maze had some common
features:

* Read maze from a file or database
* parse the file or read the database to generate the maze
* render the maze graphically or through text
* Allow WASD first person movement through the maze

Some were web based applications and some were standalone applications,
but they all combine some components of a basic application such as file
I/O, parsing, graphics or screen type I/O, and user interaction from the
keyboard.

I already have been using Python for years, but I thought I'd go back and
do this exercise for Python using Django.

    --+                          +
